## 🧾 Test Cases & Execution

Test cases were designed and executed using TestRail and Excel.

📄 [Test Cases](qa-testing-portfolio/taskboard/taskboard-test-cases(4).xlsx)  
📄 [Test Run Results](qa-testing-portfolio/taskboard/taskboard-testrun(4).xlsx)

The test run includes execution results (Pass/Fail) for functional and negative scenarios.

### 🐞 Example Bug Report

<img src="screenshots/jira/JIRA-BUGS1.png" width="700">

This bug demonstrates that data manipulation endpoints fail to reject unsupported HTTP requests, indicating missing validation and potential security vulnerabilities.

---

### 🔐 Security Test - Response Headers Validation

<img src="screenshots/jira/JIRABUGS2.png" width="700">

This test verifies that API response headers do not expose sensitive information such as server details, internal technologies, or security-related data.

The API should return only necessary headers and avoid revealing implementation details that could be exploited.

## 📊 Test Management (TestRail)

Test cases and execution results were organized in TestRail.
